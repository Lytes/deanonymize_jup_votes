## Deanonymize Jup Votes
Jup DAO votes on proposals are hidden on the jup Dao platform (vote.jup.ag) until quorum votes/voting period is over. 
However the data can still be retrieved from the Program even before the voting phase is concluded.

### install dependencies
> npm install

> Add proposal link to main.ts (line 9)

### run
> ts-node main
